# Borough

Brooklyn rental market intelligence platform. Ingests property data, signed lease comps, economic indicators, and supply pipeline data from **free public sources only** to produce a per-property **Rent Pressure Score (RPS)** and probabilistic rent forecasts.

The core strategy is **"truth through overlap"** — instead of relying on any single paid data vendor, Borough combines 16 independent free data sources and assigns confidence scores based on source authority and agreement.

---

## Architecture

The backend follows a **medallion ETL pattern**:

```
Bronze (Raw Data Lake)  →  Silver (Normalized Postgres)  →  Gold (Feature Store)  →  API
```

| Layer | Purpose | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| **Bronze** | Immutable raw payloads from 16 free public sources | S3 / MinIO (JSON) |
| **Silver** | BBL-based entity-resolved records with UUID keys (11 tables) | PostgreSQL |
| **Gold** | Pre-computed features at property and submarket level (12 calculators) | PostgreSQL |

## Data Sources (All Free)

### NYC Open Data (Socrata API) — 10 sources

|---|---|
| MapPLUTO | Property lot attributes, zoning, building class, square footage |
| DHCR Rent Stabilized | Rent-stabilized building records with legal regulated rents |
| DOB Job Filings | New building and alteration filings |
| DOB Violations | Building code violations with penalty amounts |
| HPD Violations | Housing maintenance violations (class A/B/C severity) |
| HPD Litigation | Housing court cases and case status |

| Rolling Sales | Annualized property sale records with prices |
| 311 Complaints | Noise, heat/hot water, plumbing, and building complaints |

### Federal APIs — 4 sources

| Source | Data Provided |
|---|---|
| Census ACS 5-year | Median income, population, renter occupancy, vacancy estimates |
| BLS Employment | Local area unemployment and employment trends |
| FRED Mortgage Rates | 30-year fixed mortgage rate time series |
| HUD Fair Market Rents | Official rent benchmarks by zip code and bedroom count |

### Transit and Trends — 2 sources

| Source | Data Provided |
|---|---|
| MTA Subway Ridership | Station-level daily ridership counts with lat/lng |
| Google Trends (pytrends) | Search interest signals for Brooklyn neighborhood demand |

## Source Confidence Scoring

Every data source has a confidence weight (0–100) defined in `config/constants.py`:

| Tier | Score | Sources |
|---|---|---|
| Highest (95) | Government records | PLUTO, DHCR, FRED |
| High (90) | Agency filings | DOB, HPD, Census, HUD, Building Permits, 421-a |
| Moderate (85) | Compiled data | Rolling Sales, BLS, MTA |
| Lower (80) | Complaint data | 311 Complaints |
| Lowest (50) | Search signals | Google Trends |

When multiple sources agree on a data point, composite confidence increases. This replaces the need for any paid authoritative source.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **PostgreSQL 15+** (running locally or via Docker)
- **MinIO** (for local S3-compatible bronze storage) or an AWS account
- **Redis** (for Celery task queue)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and enter the project

```bash
git clone <repo-url> Borough
cd Borough
```

### 2. Create and activate the virtual environment

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys. All keys are **free** and **optional** (they increase rate limits but are not required for basic access).

### 5. Start infrastructure services

```bash
# PostgreSQL
docker run -d --name borough-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=borough \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=borough \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=borough \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15

# MinIO (S3-compatible bronze storage)
docker run -d --name borough-minio \
  -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin \
  -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin \
  -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"

# Redis (Celery broker)
docker run -d --name borough-redis \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  redis:7
```

### 6. Run the API server

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive Swagger UI.

All keys are **optional** — APIs work without them but apply stricter rate limits. No paid services are required.

---

## Infrastructure (Terraform)

To provision the AWS S3 bronze bucket:

```bash
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform plan -var="environment=dev"
terraform apply -var="environment=dev"
```

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (Foundation):** Complete — 16 free-source extraction clients, bronze storage, 11 silver database schemas, 7 normalizers with BBL-based identity resolution.

**Phase 2 (Intelligence):** Complete — 12 feature calculators (6 property-level, 6 submarket-level), feature store orchestration, source confidence scoring.

**Phase 3 (Surface):** API stubs implemented. Full integration pending.
